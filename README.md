To get the frontend working 

Please download node from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and install

Open console and use following command :- npm install -g npm <br />
In console go to web project directory and use : npm install <br />
This should populate a node_modules folder in the project directory <br />

Building the web project should compile the sass and produce minified css and js files in the wwwroot subfolders

Please install the visual studio extension "NPM Task Runner". <br />
Once installed go to View -> Other Windows -> Task Runner Explorer. <br />
You should see "Before Build" and "Project Open" bindings as defined in the package.json.

When you build or change the sass file and save it should automatically compile the sass into css.
